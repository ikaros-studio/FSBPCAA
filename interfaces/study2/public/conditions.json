        "conversationContent": "With rapid marine economic development, the pollution of coastal water environments has become severe. Common environmental pollutants include heavy metals, persistent organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and microplastics, which have recently attracted significant attention (Storelli, 2008). Heavy metals are highly toxic substances that can continuously accumulate in the bodies of living organisms, thereby causing both acute and chronic toxic effects. Many studies have reported that different degrees of heavy metal pollution have been detected within seafood in the coastal areas of China (Liu et al., 2018; Milenkovic et al., 2019; Hossain, 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Ngoc et al., 2020; Pandion et al., 2022). Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a common persistent organic pollutant (POP) that is widely found in aquaculture environments and has stable properties, strong toxicity, and carcinogenic effects (Quintanilla-Mena et al., 2021; Ju et al., 2022).

        "conversationContent": "In the summer, belugas travel and forage across the northern reaches of the Arctic. As the weather cools and their habitats begin to freeze up, they head to the southern areas of their ranges to forage. But in recent years, rising temperatures have meant later freezeups—and researchers have wondered whether this change is affecting the timing of belugas’ migrations. What they have noticed is that different beluga populations appear to have different responses: some seem to delay their fall migration, while others simply continue their usual patterns.  For example, belugas from the Chukchi Sea delayed their fall migration by about 33 days from 2007 to 2012 compared with 1998 to 2002. This delay correlated with a significantly later freeze-up of sea ice in the region. Ultimately, the whales spent more time in their summer foraging areas. It seems these belugas may be coping with a changing Alaskan Arctic marine environment by shifting their migration timing and behaviour. (Source: Arctic WWF)",

New research from an international collaboration including CQUniversity's Coastal Marine Ecosystems Research Centre (CMERC) found almost 2 000 microplastic particles in six different species collected in the Orkney Islands north of Scotland.  Gladstone-based CMERC researcher Dr Angela Capper said the presence of microplastics in the different types of jellyfish and comb jellies was alarming given their role in marine food webs.  'Jellyfish are consumed by a range of species' from crustaceans to fish and turtles' and even human beings' with fisheries in more than 15 countries now harvesting jellyfish'' Dr Capper said.
